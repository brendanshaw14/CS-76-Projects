# Readme: 

Full documentation of this project is listed in the `report.md`.

In order to test, see `astar_test.py`, in which running the script will print a series of tests to the cosole. Outputs are also listed as comments in the file. 

Also see `MazeworldProblem.py`, where there are tests for the mazeworld methods, as well as `SensorlessProblem.py`, which includes tests for those methods. 

These are less important: if you want to see paths, uncomment some of the animate path function calls at the bottom of `astar_test.py`.
