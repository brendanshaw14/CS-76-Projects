# Foxes and Chickens Report

## Initial Discussion

To begin, I decided to use the game representation mentioned in the assignment using a tuple containing three values to represent the number of foxes, chickens, and boats on the left side of the river, respectively (for example, `(3, 3, 1)` represents the initial game state). To represent actions, I used a similar system, using another tuple to represent the change in foxes, chickens, and boats on a given side (for example, `(-2, 0, -1)`
