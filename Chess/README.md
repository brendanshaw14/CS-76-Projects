In order to run this program, go to the file `gui_chess.py` and scroll down. At the bottom is the code that runs the game in the gui, and all of the different AI should be imported. 

Read the comments, as they will show you which statements to uncomment to observe certain AI at certain depths. Make sure that only one `player1` and one `player2` are uncommented at any time. 

The design, implementation, and testing are all described in depth in `report.md`.
