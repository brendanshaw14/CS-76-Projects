For a detailed report on this assignment, see `report.md`. The report explains the design and implementation of all classes and their methods, as well how to test the code. Analysis of this testing is included in the report as well. 

To run the code, open `MapColoringProblem.py` or `CircuitBoardProblem.py` and run them. The code will execute all of the combinations of heuristics and inference with descriptions printed in the comments and to the terminal. 

You should be able to see the solutions for each execution printed to terminal, with a description of the runtime and which technique was used beside it. 

In `MapColoringProblem.py`, the variables holding the information for the United States map coloring initialization are commented out. See those comments for what to uncomment. 

Note: running those tests takes some time since th problem is much larger. Outputs are included at the bottom of the file and discussed in the report as well.
